With Mopidy MusicBox Webclient, you can play your music on your computer (`Rapsberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_) and remotely control it using your computer, tablet or phone.

This is a responsive webclient especially written for Mopidy, a music server. Responsive, so it works on desktop and mobile browsers. You can browse, search and play albums, artists, playlists, and it has cover art from Last.fm.

`Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ is a music server which can play music from Spotify, Google Music, SoundCloud, etc or from your hard drive. 

If you want to run Mopidy with this webclient on a Raspberry Pi, do yourself a favor and use my custom built SD-image: `Pi MusicBox <http://www.woutervanwijk.nl/pimusicbox/>`_.
